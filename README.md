# Registry with Letsencrypt Certificates

## Certbot

The certbot image is a wrapper of the official [certbot/certbot](https://hub.docker.com/r/certbot/certbot/)
image which can issue certificates from letsencrypt. The wrapper add the 
functionality that certificates are renewed in case they are expired.
 
For more information read the [certbot README](/certbot/README.md).

## Registry

### Configuration

#### Ports

The registry image exposes the port **5000**. You can map this port to another on the host machine.  

#### Environment variables

- **REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE:** The path to the certificate file (generated by the certbot container) 
- **REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY:** The path to the private key file (generated by the certbot container)
- **REGISTRY_AUTH:** The registry authentication methods. Possible authentication providers are *silly, token* and *htpasswd* 
- **REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_REALM:** The realm in which the registry server authenticates.
- **REGISTRY_AUTH_HTPASSWD_PATH:** The path to the `htpasswd` file to load at startup.
- **FORCE_SSL:** Whether to use SSL encrytion or not. 

#### Volumes

Mount the following volumes.

    volumes:
      - ./registry:/var/lib/registry
      - ./certs:/certs
      - ./auth:/auth

The *registry* volume stores the data pushed to the registry. The *certs* volume stores your certificates and the *auth* volume contains the htpasswd file for authentication.

## Registry frontend

The registry frontend is implemented in the image [docker-registry-frontend](https://github.com/kwk/docker-registry-frontend) maintained by Konrad Kleine.

The image is ***not*** part of the docker-compose file, because it is necessary that certain conditions are fullfilled 
before starting this image. Especially it is really necessary, that the certificates are valid and present.

### Configuration
 
#### Ports
The image exposes port 443
 
#### Environment variables
- **ENV_DOCKER_REGISTRY_HOST:** The host / container where the registry is running
- **ENV_DOCKER_REGISTRY_PORT:** The port on which the registry is running
- **ENV_USE_SSL:** Whether to use ssl or not 
- **ENV_DOCKER_REGISTRY_USE_SSL:** Whether the registry uses ssl or not

#### Volumes
In case you want an encrypted frontend it is necessary to mount your 
certificates to `/etc/apache2/server.key` and `/etc/apache2/server.crt`

Example: `$docker run ... -v $PWD/certs/dh-2.docklab.de.fullchain.pem:/etc/apache2/server.crt:ro ...`
